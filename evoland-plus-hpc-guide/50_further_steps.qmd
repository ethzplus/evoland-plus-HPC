# Further Steps

Upon completing the four steps, we obtain LULC layers, focal windows, and NCP.
These outputs can be further analyzed and utilized for additional processes,
such as species distribution modeling.

In our scenario, we have incorporated a fifth step that leverages the same
repository structure and configuration as the previous steps.
The code for this step is located in a different repository,
which ensures that the workflow remains consistent and manageable.
This additional step allows for more comprehensive analysis and
extends the capabilities of the initial four steps,
providing a robust framework for further research and application.
