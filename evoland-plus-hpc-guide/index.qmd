# What is *evoland-plus HPC*? {.unnumbered}

A unified High Performance Computing (HPC) pipeline for scenario-based modelling of future Land Use and Land Cover Change, the supply of Nature's Contributions to People (NCPs) and the distribution of species, combining several existing models and tools:

-   [Land use land cover change (LULCC) model for Switzerland](https://github.com/blenback/LULCC-CH) [@black2023; @black2024]
-   [Species distribution modelling (N-SDM)](https://github.com/N-SDM/N-SDM) [@adde2023]
-   Indicators of Nature's contributions to people (NCPs) based on [@kuelling2024]

For more details on the background on the evoland-plus HPC pipeline, see the [Introduction](intro.qmd).

## Statement of need {.unnumbered}

evoland-plus HPC was devised in order to perform simulations of alternative scenarios [@mayer2023] that depict the development of the framing conditions for the establishment of a functioning Ecological Infrastructure in Switzerland as specified in the Action Plan for the Swiss Biodiversity Strategy.

## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

The development of evoland-plus HPC and it's parent models was funded under the [ValPar.CH](https://valpar.ch/index_en.php?page=home_en) project, funded by the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN).

[N-SDM](https://github.com/N-SDM/N-SDM) was developed within the [Ecospatial Ecology Group (Ecospat)](https://www.unil.ch/ecospat/en/home.html) at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/central/en/home.html)

[LULCC-CH](https://github.com/blenback/LULCC-CH) was developed within the chair of [Planning of Landscape and Urban Systems (PLUS)](https://plus.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html)

The models of [NCPs](https://github.com/NKulling/SWISS_NCP_ASSESSMENT) were developed within the [EnviroSPACE Laboratory](https://www.unige.ch/envirospace/) at the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/).
