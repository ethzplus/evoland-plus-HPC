# Setup

To set up Future-EI for usage, you need to clone this repository, install the
models used in @fig-pipeline, and configure the local paths for inputs and parameters.
For the `bash` script, environment variables are set in the
[`src/config.json` file](https://github.com/cbueth/Future-EI/tree/main/src/config.json).

## Micromamba/Conda

For some pipeline steps, we use conda environments.
For this, we recommend using [`micromamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
it does the same thing as [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/),
but resolves dependencies much faster, with the flexibility of
[`miniconda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (only command line
interface, no GUI).
Find the installation instructions
[here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/micromamba-installation.html).
Using `conda`, the commands work the same, only `micromamba` needs to be replaced by
`conda`.
The given scripts identify the installed package manager, as can be found in
[`src/bash_functions.sh`](https://github.com/cbueth/Future-EI/tree/main/src/bash_functions.sh).

## Dinamica EGO

Dinamica EGO is available on [the project website](https://dinamicaego.com/dinamica-7/),
but will be shipped in the LULCC docker image for simplicity.

For a full description of the environments, see the environments:

## Environments

For the steps in the pipeline, different environments and modules are required.
These are collected in each step folder.
For each, there are scripts to reproduce our used environment.
To make all bash scripts in the source executable, give them the permission as
follows:

```bash
# possibly activate globstar: shopt -s globstar
chmod +x src/**/*.sh
```
