# Pipeline

The Future-EI pipeline consists out of various scripts that can be found in
the `src` directory.
For each included step of @fig-pipeline, there is a subdirectory in `src/steps`.

This part is structured as follows:

- [Setup](setup.html)
- Steps
  - [LULCC](10_LULCC.html)
  - [Check LULCC](11_CheckLULCC.html)
  - [Focals](20_FocalLULC.html)
  - [NCP](40_NCPs.html)
- [Running the pipeline](running.html)


The task of the Future-EI pipeline is to streamline the process,
so that varying the climate scenarios and other parameters can be carried out
efficiently.
Introducing parallelization
through [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) batch jobs, and
adding HPC compatibility, are the main tasks of the pipeline.
Meanwhile, the pipeline keeps track of the intermediate results,
a centralized configuration file, and the execution of each step.
Details on the individual steps are given in the following sections.
