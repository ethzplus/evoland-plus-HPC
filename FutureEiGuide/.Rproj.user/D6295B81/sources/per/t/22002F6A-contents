# What is _Future-EI_? {.unnumbered}

This is a guide and reference book for the Future-EI pipeline.
To explore future ecosystem services and nature's contributions to people (NCP)
in the context of climate scenarios, Future-EI (future ecological infrastructure)
couples the

and NCP calculations .

For more details on the background on the Future-EI pipeline, see the
[Introduction](intro.qmd).
