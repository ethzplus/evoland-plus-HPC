# Summary

The evoland-plus HPC pipeline provides a comprehensive framework
for exploring future ecosystem services and nature's contributions to people (NCP)
in the context of climate scenarios.
By following the steps outlined in this guide,
users can generate and analyze LULC layers, focal windows, and NCP,
and extend their analysis with additional steps.

Key points:

- Overview of the evoland-plus HPC pipeline and its components
- Detailed steps for setting up and configuring the pipeline
- Generation of LULC layers, focal windows, and NCP
- Integration of additional steps for more comprehensive analysis (?)
- Applications (?)

Results and implications ...


Bullet points for your notes to elaborate on regarding the results in your paper:

- Summarize the main findings of the evoland-plus HPC pipeline analysis
- Discuss the implications of the results for biodiversity conservation
- Highlight the impact of different climate scenarios on ecosystem services
- Explain the significance of LULC changes in the context of the study
